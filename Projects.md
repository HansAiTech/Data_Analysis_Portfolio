## Portfolio Projects
In this section, you will find a list of data analytics projects that I have worked on. For each project, I will provide a brief description of the problem statement and the solution approach, along with a summary of the technology stack used to implement the solution.  
The technology stack used in each project will depend on the specific requirements of the project and the data being analyzed. It may include tools such as Python for data cleaning and manipulation, SQL for data querying and analysis, Tableau or Power BI for data visualization.  
By providing information on the technology stack used in each project, I hope to give you a better understanding of the different tools and technologies that can be used in data analytics projects and how they can be applied to solve real-world business problems.
