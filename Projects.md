<p align="justify">In this section, you will find a list of data analysis projects that I have worked on. For each project, I will provide a brief description of the problem and solution approach, along with a summary of the tools used to implement the solution.<br>  
The software used in each project will depend on the specific requirements of the project and the data being analyzed. This may include tools such as Python for data cleaning and manipulation, SQL for querying and analyzing data, Tableau or Power BI for data visualization.<br>  
By providing information on the technology used in each project, I hope to provide you with a better understanding of the different tools and technologies that can be used in data analysis projects and how they can be applied to solve real-world business problems.</p>

<p align="justify">LearnData is an e-learning company that sells online courses in data analysis. Its main business problem is the lack of an established system to capture, analyze, and make decisions based on its main financial metrics, which makes it difficult to identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions. Additionally, the raw data generated by the company's website may be incomplete, inaccurate, or contain duplicates, which further complicates analysis and decision-making.
<br>
LearnData's goal is to perform data cleaning and develop a system to efficiently and effectively capture and analyze this data, enabling greater precision in analysis and more informed decision-making regarding customer and sales management. To achieve this, it utilizes tools such as WooCommerce, WordPress, and Stripe to manage its business.<br>
Language and tools used in the project: <strong>SQL, MySQL (CTE's, Subquery, Windows functions)</strong><br>
